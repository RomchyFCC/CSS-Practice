						<p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.</p>

Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.</p>

It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit.</p>
